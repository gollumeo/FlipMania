**FlipMania** is a real-time opportunity engine for the World of Warcraft Auction House, designed for players who want to maximize their goldmaking by capitalizing on market inefficiencies across servers.

## Tech Stack

* .NET (modular Clean Architecture)

* Strict separation of layers: Api / Application / Domain / Infrastructure / Persistence / Presentation / Tests

## Who is this for?
